An embedded systems student at HEIG-VD. Currently in my first year of master

During my bachelor I specialized in embedded development, with mainly C and VHDL, and in multiple platforms ranging from a raspberry pi or a jetson nano to a SoC from Altera or Xilinx.

During my master I am currently specializing in Software Engineering, with an accent on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, IoT and Mobile Development.

I am also proeficient in Python, java, C++, Kotlin and bash, and many more.

In my free time I'm really interested about the folowing topics :
