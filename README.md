# David González León

I am a Software Engineer graduated from HES-SO, with a master in Software Engineering, and a bachelor in Computer Science with a specialisation in embeddedd engineering from HEIG-VD.

During my bachelor I specialized in embedded development, with mainly C and VHDL, and in multiple platforms ranging from a raspberry pi or a jetson nano to a SoC from Altera or Xilinx.

During my master I specialised in Software Engineering, with an accent on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, DevOps, Cloud, IoT and Mobile Development with flutter.

I am also proficient in Python, Javascript/Typescript, java, C++ and bash, and many more.

In my free time I'm really interested about the following topics :

-   Homelabs and automation
-   Kubernetes
-   Ansible and automatic/strong deployment
-   Domotic and embedded appliances
-   Machine learning
